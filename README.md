The Web App source code has been divided into two parts: Frontend and Backend.
The Frontend contains the React App needed to run the project. 
The Backend Contains the Server.

#### To run Backend
```sh
cd backend/
npm i
node server.js
```

#### To Run Frontend
Pull the latest version from github

```sh
cd frontend/
npm i
npm run dev
```
## Developer Tools
Few scripts have been added in the devtools directory inside backend for testing and debugging.
Here are a few of them :
